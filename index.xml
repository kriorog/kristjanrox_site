<p>Thanks for tuning in.</p>
</section>
<section id="but-seriously" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-seriously">But seriously…</h2>
<p>This is the typical starting point for anyone writing down the 2nd law of motion. But it’s just not what it is.</p>
<p>The version written above is a special case. Firstly, acceleration <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> is a vector, so we should writhe <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Ba%7D"> instead of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a">. If our analysis is one dimensional - then we can reduce <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Ba%7D"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a">, but in general it is a vector quantity as a vector can be one dimensions - or however many dimensions you like.</p>
<p>Secondly, Newton wasn’t thinking about acceleration of a fixed mass - rather he was thinking about how momentum changes with time. His original formulation was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D=%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cvec%7Bp%7D%7D%7Bdt%7D,"></p>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Bp%7D"> is momentum, defined as: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Bp%7D=m%5Cvec%7Bv%7D,"></p>
<p>and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D"> is the total <strong>external</strong> force acting upon a system. So a total force <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D"> causes a change in momentum <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Bp%7D"> with respect to time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> - and an observed change in momentum can be related to a total force <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D"> acting on the system.</p>
<p>In the absence of external forces, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D=0">, momentum is conserved, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cvec%7Bp%7D%7D%7Bdt%7D=0"> - i.e.&nbsp;it does not change with time.</p>
<p>A conserved quantity in physics is gold - as it allows us to relate two states of a system without knowing the details of how the system got from one state to another, since (in this case) the momentum is the same at both states. Another key conserved quantity is energy <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E">.</p>
<p>Since mass <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> is a scalar, and velocity <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Bv%7D"> is a vector, the momentum is a scaled velocity vector, i.e.&nbsp;it has the same direction as velocity, but its magnitude is scaled by mass.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-general-form" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-general-form">The general form</h2>
<p>Carrying out the differentiation using the product rule gives:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D=%5Cfrac%7Bd(m%5Cvec%7Bv%7D)%7D%7Bdt%7D=m%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cvec%7Bv%7D%7D%7Bdt%7D+%5Cvec%7Bv%7D%5Cfrac%7Bdm%7D%7Bdt%7D."></p>
<p>What we typically do is consider mass to be constant, so the second term vanishes to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?dm/dt=0">, leaving us with:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D=m%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cvec%7Bv%7D%7D%7Bdt%7D=m%5Cvec%7Ba%7D,"></p>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cvec%7Bv%7D%7D%7Bdt%7D=%5Cvec%7Ba%7D"> is acceleration, the change in velocity with time. This is our familiar form of the 2nd law of motion.</p>
<p>So our typical form is just a special case of the more general form.</p>
<p>Because this is a vector equation, it encodes quite alot of information. If our problem is one dimensions, this reduces to a scalar equation (one equation). For two dimensions, the vector equation encodes two scalar equations (one for each component), and in three dimensions it encodes three scalar equations.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-does-this-matter" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h2>
<p>In many practical applications, the mass of the system is not constant with respect to time.</p>
<p>Anyone who has studied fluid mechanics or rocket propulsion will be familiar with the more general form, where mass is not constant with respect to time. In rockets, mass is expelled (the propellant) and in fluid dynamics mass flow in a control volume is variable with time. However, for rockets, the general form needs to be used with care while considering relative velocities. Starting out with a scalar <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F=ma"> in those fields will not get you very far.</p>
</section>
<section id="embracing-first-principles" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embracing-first-principles">Embracing first principles</h2>
<p>I’ve always tried to keep in mind the first principles of physics. Newton’s laws are exactly that - first principles. They are not just equations to be memorized, but rather they are the foundation upon which we build our understanding of mechanics.</p>
<p>When we start with the more general form of Newton’s 2nd law, we are reminded that forces cause changes in momentum, and that momentum can change not only due to changes in velocity but also due to changes in mass. This broader perspective is crucial for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena.</p>
<p>Instead of starting half way down the road with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F=ma">, starting with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D=d%5Cvec%7Bp%7D/dt"> and then performing acceptable adjustments or simplifacations to the problem at hand keeps us grounded in the fundamental concepts of physics and encourages us to think more deeply about the systems we are analyzing. It does not cost anything extra to remember the more general form, and it pays off in the long run.</p>
</section>
<section id="deriving-the-rocket-equation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deriving-the-rocket-equation">Deriving the rocket equation</h2>
<p>Let’s develop the equation of motion for a rocket in one dimension. We start with the general form</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cvec%7Bp%7D%7D%7Bdt%7D%20=%20m%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%20+%20%5Cfrac%7Bdm%7D%7Bdt%7D%5Cvec%7Bv%7D."></p>
<p>Every rocket, regardless of the actual propulsion device, generates thrust by expelling mass. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?dm/dt"> term is therefore important for thrust. There is however a problem with this formulation - without additional context. A stationary rocket (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v=0">) can generate thrust by expelling mass <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?dm/dt%3C0">. However, that term vanishes at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t=0"> if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Bv%7D(0)=%5Cvec%7B0%7D">.</p>
<p>We need to clarify that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Bv%7D=%5Cvec%7Bv%7D(t)"> in the above formulation is the velocity of the expelled mass relative to the rocket. Let’s call that velocity <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BV%7D_e">, which has direction opposite the rocket’s velocity vector <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Bv%7D">,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20=%20m%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7Bdm%7D%7Bdt%7D%5Cvec%7BV%7D_e."></p>
<p>In the absence of the atmosphere, we can ignore aerodynamic drag. However, to allow for it, we’ll leave the external force component <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F"> in the equation, to yield after rearranging.</p>
<p>As we are in one dimenson, we can drop the vector notation,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F%20=%20ma%20-%20%5Cfrac%7Bdm%7D%7Bdt%7DV_e."></p>
<p>Since the term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bdm%7D%7Bdt%7DV_e"> is thrust (a force), we can rearrange the terms to obtain</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F%20+%20%5Cfrac%7Bdm%7D%7Bdt%7DV_e%20=%20ma."></p>
<p>As <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?dm/dt%3C0"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_e%3C0"> the thrust term is positive - which makes sense. Increased thrust should yield an increase in acceleration <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> for a given mass <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">.</p>
<p>It is understandable that this derivation leaves some questions unanswered. In particular, consider that we have the acceleration term of the rocket <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Ba%7D=%5Cvec%7Ba%7D(t)"> in an inertial frame of reference, but the thrust component has a velocity <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BV%7D_e"> which is observed in the rocket’s frame of reference. How does that make sense?</p>

<p>The quantity <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?dm"> is the change in rocket mass, which is negative. The mass of the expelled fuel is therefore -dm.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the inertial velocity vector of the exhaust mass <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?dm"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Bv%7D+%5Cvec%7BV%7D_e">, while <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7BV%7D_e"> is the exhaust velocity vector relative to the rocket (accelerating frame of reference).</p>
<p>The second order differential component <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?dmd%5Cvec%7Bv%7D"> is much smaller than other components, and is thus taken to be zero.</p>
<p>We have now set up a finite difference in momentum <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta%20%5Cvec%7Bp%7D"> between these two points in time.

<p>can even be a step to far in some cases.</p>
<p>For the rocket, considering <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Bp%7D=m%5Cvec%7Bv%7D"> and taking its time derivative is not a representative model of the rocket’s change in momentum with time.</p>
<p>We should have started with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?dp/dt"> and derived that relation and then relate it to any external forces with the 2nd law - as was shown above.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="a-tangent---mass-and-the-2nd-law-in-other-contexts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-tangent---mass-and-the-2nd-law-in-other-contexts">A tangent - mass and the 2nd law in other contexts</h2>
<p>Let’s venture off on a tangent from this topic and consider mass in other contexts.</p>
<p>In simple terms, mass is a measure of inertia. Inertia is the resistance of an object to change in its state of motion. The greater the mass, the greater the inertia, and the more force is required to change its momentum.</p>
<p>Contrast this to a large corporation. A large corporation has a lot of inertia - it is resistant to change. Changing the direction of a large corporation requires significant effort and resources, much like changing the momentum of a massive object requires a large force. It is much easier to change the direction of a small startup company (low mass) than a large multinational corporation (high mass).</p>
<p>However, the mass of a corporation is not fixed. Mergers, acquisitions, layoffs, and growth can all change the “mass” of a corporation over time. This is analogous to the variable mass scenarios in physics where the mass of a system changes with time. However, in this context, these changes with time are not continuous, so the function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m(t)"> is not differentiable everywhere.</p>
<section id="parkinsons-law---the-mass-of-bureaucracy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parkinsons-law---the-mass-of-bureaucracy">Parkinson’s Law - the mass of bureaucracy</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s Law</a> states that “work expands to fill the time available for its completion.” In the context of a corporation, this can be interpreted as the tendency for bureaucratic processes to grow in complexity and size over time, regardless of the actual workload. This growth in bureaucracy can be seen as an increase in the “mass” of the corporation, making it more resistant to change and less agile.</p>
<p>This means that the change in mass of government - and thus of its inertia - is always increasing with time, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?dm/dt%3E0"> always. As such, considering it at moving at constant velocity at a given time (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d%5Cvec%7Bv%7D/dt=0">), the magnitude of the force needed to make any change also increases with time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%7C%7Bd%5Cvec%7BF%7D/dt%7D%5Cright%7C%3E0">. In other words, it just gets harder and harder with time to notice any impact of changes made, or a lot more effort has to be expelled for a unit change to be observed. This is an interesting contrast to physical systems where mass can both increase and decrease with time.</p>
<p>However, I have worked in companies that display a chronic beurocratic bloat, where the mass seems to increase without bound. In such cases, the corporation becomes so massive and inertial that it is nearly impossible to change its direction or adapt to new circumstances. So this is not limited to just government…</p>

  <title>Does zero probability imply impossibility?</title>
  <dc:creator>Röx </dc:creator>
  <link>www.kristjanrox.com/articles/04_zero_probability/01_part 1/zero_prob_part_1.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Consider a random event <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> having probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(X)=0">. Does <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(X)=0"> mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> cannot occur, i.e.&nbsp;is impossible?</p>
<p>At face value, the question seems harmless, but as soon as one starts to attempt an answer to it using mathematical logic alone - one realizes that probability theory is a symphony of both logic and philosophy.</p>
<p>The notion of <em>probabilities</em> is subject to interpretation, and can be argued in a philosophical sense, as it is an abstraction of reality. Consequently, there are various interpretations and approaches to probability theory. However, given a specific interpretation of what probability is, we base our logic on certain <em>axioms of probability</em>, which are mathematical constructs and not subject to interpretation.</p>
<section id="an-informal-approach" class="level1">
<h1>An informal approach</h1>
<p>I would like to motivate an answer to this question using a relatively informal approach - while still allowing use of elementary mathematical notations of probabilities.</p>
<section id="an-example-random-process" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-example-random-process">An example random process</h2>
<p>Let’s consider a random process which assigns values to the random variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> be the set of all possible outcomes of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">, i.e.&nbsp;we draw <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> or that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X%20%5Cin%20%5COmega">. Now, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> can be a finite set with only <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> elements or an infinite set.</p>
<p>Given this information, we can’t say what the probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X)">. The probability function is one that we have assigned to the random process, which we are confident will describe the relative frequency of different <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> values from repeated trials of the random process. It is therefore dependent on what elements are in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega">.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="a-finite-number-of-possible-outcomes" class="level1">
<h1>A finite number of possible outcomes</h1>
<p>Suppose that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> contains all natural numbers between 1 and 6, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega%20=%20%5C%7B1,%202,%20%5Cdots%20,%206%5C%7D">. This could describe the possible outcomes of a single standard die. The random variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> then describes the value obtained in each trial, i.e.&nbsp;each die cast. The probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> taking a specific value in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> depends on the die itself and how it is cast.</p>
<p>Let’s assume the die to be <em>perfect</em> and the cast process to be fair, then one value in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> will not occur more often than any other value in repeated trials. For such a process, the frequency of all values approaches the same value as the number of trials increases. For such a result, a <em>discrete uniform probability distribution</em> would be an appropriate probability function for this process. We would then say that the die value in each cast follows a uniform distribution, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X%20%5Csim%20%5Cmathcal%7BU%7D(N_%7B%5COmega%7D)"> and the probability of obtaining a value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X=a">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%20%5Cin%20%5COmega">, is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X=a)=1/N_%7B%5COmega%7D%20=%201/6">.</p>
<p>This is the same interpretation as the classical definition of probability a la Bernoulli and Laplace:</p>

<p>Note that each possible outcome of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is equally probable, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X=a)=1/6"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%20%5Cin%20%5COmega">. So only values not in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> will have probability zero, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X=a)=0"> only if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%20%5Cnotin%20%5COmega">. That is not an interesting result, and I would say it to be trivial. The only such results which one could possibly argue to be theoretically possible is for the die not to return any element in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega">, i.e.&nbsp;to return the empty set. That would describe the case where the die ends up balanced on an edge, without any particular side facing up. However, such an outcome has most likely never been observed and is accurately assigned a zero probability by the uniform distribution, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X=%5Cemptyset)=0">. However, an outcome of values <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X%3E6"> is absurd and will have zero probability since <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X%3E6)%20=%201%20-%20P(X%20%5Cleq%206)%20=%201-1%20=0"> - so this result is indeed impossible.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the discrete random variable case, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is discrete, with finite possible outcomes in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega">, the only outcomes with zero probability are those which are impossible by definition.</p>

<section id="what-if-n_omega-to-infty" class="level1">
<h1>What if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N_%7B%5COmega%7D%20%5Cto%20%5Cinfty">?</h1>
<p>Consider now that the size of the finite outcome set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> increases towards <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinfty">. We can do that in essentially two ways, either <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> includes more and more natural numbers until <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> equals the set of all natural numbers, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D">, or it includes more values between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?6"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega%20%5Cto%20%5B1,%206%5D">.</p>
<p>A key difference in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> between these two options, is that the first case where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega%20%5Cto%20%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D"> is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> remains <em>countably infinite</em>, i.e.&nbsp;there exists a one-to-one mapping between each element of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> and the natural numbers. In the latter case, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega%20%5Cto%20%5B1,%206%5D">, is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> becomes <em>uncountably infinite</em>.</p>
<p>In both cases, the number of possible outcomes approaches infinity with increasing size of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega">. As the uniform probability assumption still holds, each element in the set is equally likely to be obtained in each trial. Therefore, we can state that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AP(X=a)%20=%20%5Clim_%7BN_%7B%5COmega%7D%20%5Cto%20%5Cinfty%7D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN_%7B%5COmega%7D%7D%20=%200.%0A"></p>
<p>However, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N_%7B%5COmega%7D"> remains finite, although approaching infinity the probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1/N_%7B%5COmega%7D"> is defined and finite, although possibly very small or infinitesimal, but not zero. When <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> has become either <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D"> or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B1,6%5D"> the discrete uniform distribution is no longer defined.</p>
<p>However, when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega%20=%20%5B1,6%5D"> the outcome set is a continous range of reals. For such a problem, we can use a continous uniform distribution. We can use a probability density function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f_X(x)%20=%201/(6-1)=1/5"> where the probability of obtaining a value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20%5Cleq%20X%20%5Cleq%20a"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AP(1%20%5Cleq%20X%20%5Cleq%20a)%20=%20%5Cint_%7B1%7D%5E%7Ba%7Df_X(x)dx%0A"></p>
<p>Note here that the probability of obtaining <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X=a"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AP(X%20=%20a)%20=%20P(a%20%5Cleq%20X%20%5Cleq%20a)%20=%20%5Cint_%7Ba%7D%5E%7Ba%7D%20f_X(a)dx%20=%20F_X(a)%20-%20F_X(a)%20=%200.%0A"></p>
<p>So the probability of obtaining exactly a specific remains zero, but the probability of obtaining a value in an interval is non-zero, with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(1%20%5Cleq%20X%20%5Cleq%206)%20=%201">. This matches our previous conclusion, that as the number of possible outcomes increases to infinity the probability of a specific value approaches zero.</p>
<p>Applying the same logic to the case when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D"> is not as well defined, as it now has become a countably infinite set of discrete values.</p>
<p>A discrete uniform distribution cannot be applied on such a set, since the probability of each value would be zero while the sum of the probability of each value must sum to unity. A density function cannot be defined as well since the possible values are not continuous. Therefore, such a probability distribution cannot satisfy all <em>axioms of probabilities</em>. However, for the sake of this argument, we can use the limit approach as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega%20%5Cto%20%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D">, i.e.&nbsp;as a countably finite <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> approaches a countably infinite <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega">, and say that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X=a)%20=%201/N_%7B%5COmega%7D%20%5Cto%200"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%20%5Cin%20%5COmega">.</p>
<p>This conclusion for countably infinite sets applies only to the discrete uniform probability distribution. Any other distribution, non-uniform, can be defined as certain values are more probable to occur than others, so we can satisfy all of the axioms.</p>
</section>
<section id="but-something-must-happen..right" class="level1">
<h1>But something must happen..right?</h1>
<p>Even though our outcome set becomes infinite, either countably or uncountably, we will get outcomes from repeated trials of our random process. Therefore, even though a specific value has zero probability of being obtained, it can still be the outcome.</p>
<p>Using our example process, then obtaining, say, a value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X=4"> regardless of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega%20=%20%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D"> or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega%20=%20%5B1,6%5D"> is possible, yet has probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X=4)=0">. This outcome is absolutely reasonable, just extremely improbable. It is extremely improbable to obtain this value, or any specific value, more than once from repeated trials when the possible outcomes are infinitely many and none being more likely to occur than others.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Given the preceding informal discussion, we can argue that an event with zero probability does not have to be impossible - but an impossible event will have zero probability. Impossible events are those which are not in our outcome set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> for a random process.</p>
<p>Instead, a value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P=0"> for an event in the set of possible outcomes should be read as <em>improbable</em> not <em>impossible</em>.</p>

  <title>The Monty Hall Problem - Part 2</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In <a href="../../../articles/01_monty_hall/01_part_1/monty_hall.html">Part 1</a>, the solution to the Monty Hall problem required a certain level of intuition to be accepted. The fact that the prior 2/3 probability of choosing the wrong door being fully transferred to the other door that Monty did not open may not be immediately obvious. Therefore, the reasoning provided is not complete.</p>
<p>I prefer to let the mathematics - the language of logic and reason - yield a justified solution, without needing to accept a solution based on intuition.</p>
<p>In this article I will describe two solution approaches:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Using the dependent nature of both Monty’s choices and the choice the contestant has to make after being offered the choice of switching or staying to define <em>conditional probabilities</em>. These are probabilities which are conditional on what information one has at the time of making a choice. For example, Monty chooses his door based on where the car is (which he knows) and what door the contestant chooses. Given this information, the probability that Monty will choose each door is not equal, and may be biased to one or more doors. Similarly, the contestant will have to make a choice on whether to switch based on his initially chosen door and the door that Monty opened.</p></li>
<li><p>Deriving a solution by counting all of the different possible scenarios that can occur and what the contestant should do in each case. Then count how often a switch or stay choice should be made. The frequency of each choice relative to the total number of possible cases will help us determine which choice is better.</p></li>

<section id="conditional-probabilities" class="level1">
<h1>Conditional probabilities</h1>
<p>Let’s begin by defining some variables for our problem.</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> describe the door hiding the car, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> be the door chosen by the contestant, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> the door opened by Monty.</p>
<p>Based on the structure and mechanics of the problem, one can see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We assume no bias in the location of the car behind door <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">.</p></li>
<li><p>When Monty chooses his door <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> he knows the values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y">.</p></li>
<li><p>The contestant initially chooses <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> at random, as he has no other information at that stage.</p></li>
<li><p>When offered the switch, the contestant strategy would be to choose the door with the highest probability of hiding the car - given the initially chosen <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> and the door <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> opened by Monty.</p></li>
<li><p>In mathematical terms, the strategy would be to choose door <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> with the highest probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X%20%7C%20Y,%20Z)">, i.e.&nbsp;the <em>the probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> given <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"></em>. This is a <em>conditional probability</em> as it is dependent on known values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z">.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Given the information in tshe problem, deducing the desired probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X%20%7C%C2%A0Y,%20Z)"> by inspection is difficult. It is what we are trying to justify by intuition in <a href="../../../articles/01_monty_hall/01_part_1/monty_hall.html">Part 1</a> on this problem as being 2/3 in favour of switching.</p>
<section id="inspection-of-each-variable-in-the-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inspection-of-each-variable-in-the-problem">Inspection of each variable in the problem</h2>
<p>We can however see that the contestant chooses his initial door at random, i.e.&nbsp;each is equally likely to be chosen. Therefore, we can state that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Y_j)=1/3"> for each door <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j%5Cin%5C%7B1,2,3%5C%7D">.</p>
<p>Also, the car’s location is not dependent on anything. We can thus assume it being placed behind a door at random, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X_i)=1/3"> for each <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20%5Cin%20%5C%7B1,2,3%5C%7D">.</p>
<p>Therefore, the variables <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> are independent random variables.</p>
<p>However, Monty’s chosen door <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> is dependent on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y">. Therefore, we can’t model <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Z_k)"> for each <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k%20%5Cin%20%5C%7B1,2,3%5C%7D"> based on the structure and mechanics of the problem. However, we can model the conditional probability of what Monty does, given where the car is and what door the contestant initially chooses. Therefore, we can model <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Z_k%20%7C%20X_i,%20Y_j)"> for various combinations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i,j,k)">.</p>

<p>The premise of Bayesian probabilities is the notion that models of proabilities for a specific process or problem are in themselves predictions subject to likelihoods. Given certain observations, one aims to find the model with maximum likelihood of having produced the observed events.</p>
<p>Bayes’ Law can therefore be interpreted as relating the model’s likelihood given observed events, to the probability of observing the events given the model.</p>
<p>In our case, the <em>probability model</em> are the conditional probabilities <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Z_k%20%7C%20X_i,%20Y_j)"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i,j,k)"> we deduced from the structure and mechanics of the problem, and would be analogous to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(B%20%7C%20A)"> in the above definition of Bayes’ Law. We should rather refer to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Z_k%20%7C%20X_i,%20Y_j)"> as being the <em>likelihood</em> of observing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z_k"> given <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y_j">.</p>
<p>The posterior probability is the one we are interested in, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X_i%20%7C%20Y_j,%20Z_k)"> which would be analogous to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(A%20%7C%20B)"> in Bayes’ Law.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can infer our desired conditional probability based on our likelihood model and the prior probabilities.</p>
<section id="bayes-law-applied-to-the-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bayes-law-applied-to-the-problem">Bayes’ Law applied to the problem</h2>
<p>Note that Bayes’ Law considers one conditional event on each side of the equation.</p>
<p>Therefore, for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Z_k%20%7C%20X_i,%20Y_j)"> to be analogous to the Bayes’ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(B%20%7C%20A)">, we need to interpret the conditional event as being <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%20=%20(X_i,%20Y_j)"> i.e.&nbsp;the event of obtaining the values <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y_j"> for each door pair <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i,j)"> in the same run of the game.</p>
<p>However, we have established that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y_j"> are <em>independent</em> events for all pairs <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i,j)">. Therefore, the probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X_i,%20Y_j)%20=%20P(X_i)P(Y_j)">. We have the prior probabilities of both <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> as being <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X_i)=P(Y_j)=1/3"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">.</p>
<p>For our desired probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X_i%20%7C%20Y_j,%20Z_k)"> we need the probability of the event <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20=%20(Y_j,%20Z_k)"> i.e.&nbsp;the combined event of observing values <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y_j"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z_k"> in each run of the game.

<p>With this, we can determine the required prior <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Y_j,%20Z_k)">. First, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability">definition of conditional probability</a>, we can write</p>

<p>Then, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability">Total Law of Probability</a> on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Z_k%20%7C%20Y_j)">, we obtain for a given <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"></p>

<p>We have now demonstrated our ability to construct all of the required elements in Bayes’ Law for its application to the Monty Hall problem.</p>

<p>This will only be valid as long as the denominator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Y_j,%20Z_k)%20%5Cneq%200">, which it always is for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j%20%5Cneq%20k"> as Monty never opens the same door as the contestant.

<p>To construct our model of the likelihood <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Z_k%20%7C%20X_i,%20Y_j)"> we need to re-visit Monty’s behaviour in the game from <a href="../../../articles/01_monty_hall/01_part_1/monty_hall.html">Part 1</a>.</p>

<li><p>If the contestant initially chooses the correct door, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_i%20=%20Y_j">, then Monty has two doors to choose from. Since both of these do not hide the car, we can assume he chooses at random.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-on-bayesian-solution">Conclusion on Bayesian solution</h2>
<p>The obtained results show, for all possible cases, the probability of winning being higher by switching to the other door.</p>
<p>This results, obtained using the Bayesian approach is the same as the one described in <a href="../../../articles/01_monty_hall/01_part_1/monty_hall.html">Part 1</a> - which we also reinforced by simulation. What we have done differently in this solution - is to have the mathematics yield the outcome, without having to rely upon unjustified intuition or insight.</p>
<p>The solution for the optimal strategy being to always switch doors does however not mean that it will guarantee a win in each trial - not at all. Instead, what this solution tells us, is that by following the strategy of switching doors, we can expect to win in 66.7% of the time, and lose in 33.3% of the time. We should observe this to be the outcome in repeated trials and approach these values as more and more trials are done. This is what we observed in the simulation in <a href="../../../articles/01_monty_hall/01_part_1/monty_hall.html">Part 1</a>.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind, the above calculations are not a <em>simulation</em> of the problem, but exact mathematical calculations. The solution is therefore exact and complete, given our assumptions of the problem and our Bayesian interpretation of probabilities.</p>
<p>There is something inherently beautiful in having mathematics, the language of reason and logic, yield us the solution without having any prior bias towards the outcome - although in this case we have an expectation towards the outcome, but none of that was part of the derivation of the above solution.</p>
<p>Given the debates this problem has stirred in the past - based on its counterintuitive solution - a mathematical approach is indeed the only way to justify the outcome.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="another-solution-by-counting" class="level1">
<h1>Another solution by counting</h1>
<p>There is another way to justify the optimal strategy being to switch choices. If we review the previous Bayesian solution, we can see the probabilities are dependent on whether the contestant initially chose the right door or not. Let’s look at each scenario in more details.</p>
<p>The total number of different possible combinations of the car’s door <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> and the contestant’s chosen door <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%5E2=9">, i.e.&nbsp;there are 3 possible doors for each. The number of combinations where the contestant chooses the right door is only <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3">, i.e.&nbsp;there are 3 doors for the first choice but only 1 door for the second choice.</p>
<p>Consequently, the number of combinations where a wrong door is chosen is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?9-3=6">. So the contestant will choose correctly, assuming random choices, only <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3/9=1/3"> of the time and incorrectly <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2/3"> of the time. So, we repeat our initially conclusion that the contestant has a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1/3"> probability of choosing the right door.</p>
<p>When the contestant chooses the right door, Monty will have two doors to choose from which do not have the car. Regardless of which one he opens, the other remanining door will not have the car. Therefore, Monty’s chosen door is irrelevant to the problem and the contestant should not switch doors in these 3 cases out of all 9 possible.</p>
<p>However, for the other case, where the contestant chooses the wrong door, then Monty only has one door to choose from which does not have the car. Similarly, as for the other case, Monty’s choice is irrelevant because it is implied. The other remaining door will be the one with the car and the contestant should switch doors. This happens 6 times out of the possible 9 cases.</p>
<p>So the number of cases where the contestant should stay is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1/3"> and the number of cases where he should switch is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2/3"> out of all possible cases. Therefore, we reach the same conclusion regarding the frequency of each choice in the game, i.e.&nbsp;the contestant should choose a switch each time which will be successful in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2/3"> of repeated trials (in the limit). However, this counting that we have done is based on Monty’s bias and what doors he has to choose from in each possible combination of the doors where the car is and what door the contestant chooses, which is akin to our conditional probability approach using the Bayes’ Law.</p>

  <title>The Monty Hall Problem - Part 1</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The Monty Hall Problem is a famous probability brainteaser based on a game show scenario. It is named after Monty Hall, the original host of the television game show “Let’s Make a Deal.” The problem is known for its counterintuitive solution, which often surprises people - and still sparks debate among statisticians and enthusiasts alike.</p>
<p>The problem was first posed by Steve Selvin in a letter to the journal “The American Statistician” in 1975. It gained widespread attention after being featured in Marilyn vos Savant’s “Ask Marilyn” column in Parade magazine in 1990.</p>
<p>Marilyn’s response sparked a significant public debate, as many readers found disagreed with her solution and explanation. The Monty Hall Problem has since become a classic example in probability theory and is often used to illustrate the importance of considering all available information when making decisions, and who exactly is privy to that information.</p>
<p>We’ll explore the problem, its solution, and the reasoning behind it.</p>
<section id="the-basic-problem-statement" class="level1">
<h1>The basic problem statement</h1>
<p>The original problem is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You are a contestant on a game show.</li>
<li>There are three doors: behind one door is a car (the prize you want), and behind the other two doors are goats (which you don’t want).</li>
<li>You pick one door (say, Door 1).</li>
<li>The host, who knows what’s behind all the doors, opens another door (say, Door 3) that has a goat behind it.</li>
<li>The host then gives you the option to switch your choice to the remaining unopened door (Door 2) or stick with your original choice (Door 1).</li>
</ol>
<p>What should you do to maximize your chances of winning the car?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="www.kristjanrox.com/articles/01_monty_hall/01_part_1/figures/Monty_open_door.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:70.0%"></p>
<figcaption><em>The setup of the game after Monty reveals a goat</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The immediate intuition might suggest that after Monty offers us the switch, we now only have two doors to choose from, with each being equally likely, i.e.&nbsp;the odds being 50/50. So it does not matter whether we switch or stay. However, this is not the case.</p>
<p>Vos Savant’s solutions was that you should <em>always</em> switch doors.</p>
<p>Why? By switching, you have a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while if you stick with your original choice, you only have a 1/3 chance. However, this solution is dependent on the exact problem statement given. If the problem statement is changed, in particular the host’s behavior, the solution may also change.</p>
<p>The disagreements and debates around the Monty Hall Problem often stem from misunderstandings of the problem’s conditions and the role of the host’s actions. Many people assume that the host’s choice to open a door is random, but in reality, the host always opens a door with a goat behind it, which provides additional information that affects the probabilities. In technical terms, the host’s actions are not independent from the contestant’s choice, and this dependency is crucial to understanding the correct solution.</p>
<p>The original <em>Ask Marilyn</em> column, vos Savant’s response, and subsequent reader correspondence be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130121183432/http://marilynvossavant.com/game-show-problem/">here</a>.</p>
<section id="its-all-about-what-information-is-known" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="its-all-about-what-information-is-known">It’s all about what information is known</h2>
<p>The fundamentals of stochastic problems are directly related to what information is known and by whom.</p>
<p>A common assumption in stochastic processes is that different events are <em>Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d)</em>. This means that one event does not affect any subsequent events, and they are drawn from the same probability distribution. If a subsequent event is dependent on the outcome of a previous event, we’d have to look at conditional probabilites given the outcome of the first event.</p>
<p>In the beginning, we have three doors, and the probability of the car being behind any door is 1/3. When you pick a door, you have a 1/3 chance of having picked the car and a 2/3 chance of having picked a goat. We do not know where the car is, and do not have any other information at this time to help us make a better choice. The probabilities are uniformly distributed between all options.</p>
<p>However, after we make our initial choice, the host’s action is not random - it’s deterministic and dependent our chosen door and where the car is (which he knows).</p>
<section id="therein-lies-the-key-to-understanding-the-problem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="therein-lies-the-key-to-understanding-the-problem">Therein lies the key to understanding the problem</h3>
<p>The host knows where the car is and once we choose a door, he will always open a door that has a goat behind it. This biased action provides us with new information that changes the probabilities. We can reinforce this understanding by considering the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The host will never open the door you initially picked.</li>
<li>The host knows where the car is and will always open a door with a goat behind it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Out of the two doors we did not choose, the host’s choice between those two doors provides valuable information to our problem which is not random, and thus allows us to update our probabilities for the remaining two unopened doors.</p>
<p>However, had the host opened a door at random, even possibly the one we initially picked, the probabilities would remain 50/50 between the two remaining doors, as no new information would have been provided that allows us to updated our probabilities from the initial uniform probabilities. In other words, the host’s choices would be <em>Independent and Identically Distributed</em> as our choice of door to open.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="the-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-solution">The solution</h2>
<p>So, here is the full solution.</p>
<p>We have gone over the probabilities at the initial choice of door by the contestant, the one chosen has probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p=1/3"> of having the car, the other two doors have a combined probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1-p=2/3"> of having the car. The probabilities add up to 1 since there is only one car and one door must be opened - i.e.&nbsp;something will happen, either a car is revealed or not.</p>
<p>Although there is 2/3 probability of the car being behind either of the other two doors, we don’t know which one out of those two to pick. We need more information to make a better choice.</p>
<p>However, the host’s knowledge and actions will help us with this problem. Since the host will only choose a door out of the two unchosen doors, and will never open the door with the car - should it be behind either of them - the other door he did not choose becomes more valuable to us, since the full 2/3 probability of the car being behind either of the two unchosen doors now tranfers fully to the door not chosen by the host. We now don’t have to choose between the other two doors, the host has eliminated one for us free of charge. This is called variable change - i.e the actions by the host changes the variables of our problem.</p>
<p>There is a famous classroom scene in the movie “21” from 2008 where this is explained quite well (see below). There is also a great numberphile video explaining the problem and solution in detail.</p>
<p>Here is the scene from 21:</p>

<p>Here is the numberphile video:</p>

</iframe>
<p>The scene from 21 is also of interest from the other topic discussed, namely Newton’s method - or Newton-Raphson method - for finding roots of functions and the possible issues with that method. This is a topic for another time though.</p>

<section id="different-host-behavior" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="different-host-behavior">Different host behavior</h2>
<p>It is important to note that the solution to the Monty Hall Problem is dependent on the host’s behavior. If the host’s actions were different, the probabilities and optimal strategy could change. For example, if the host were to open a door at random, without knowledge of what is behind the doors, the probabilities would indeed be 50/50 between the two remaining doors after one is opened, and switching or staying would not matter. In other words, such behaviour by the host would not provide any additional information to the contestant.</p>
<p>We can look at various different host behaviors and see how they affect the solution:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Host always opens a door with a goat (standard Monty Hall Problem)</strong>: The optimal strategy is to always switch, giving a 2/3 chance of winning the car.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host opens a door at random</strong>: It does not matter if you stick with your first choice or change to the other remaining door, as the probabilities are 50/50 between the two remaining doors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host only opens a door if the contestant initially picked the car</strong>: In this case, the optimal strategy is to always stick with the original choice, as switching would lead to a guaranteed loss.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host opens a door only if the contestant initially picked a goat</strong>: Here, the optimal strategy is to always switch, as switching would lead to a guaranteed win.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These variations illustrate how the host’s behavior can significantly impact the probabilities and optimal strategies in the Monty Hall Problem.</p>

<h1>How do we know that Monty is biased?</h1>
<p>This is an interesting question to ask. Our solution is based on our knowledge of how Monty behaves in the way we have assumed. However, say we were seeing this game for the first time, do we know that Monty is biased?</p>
<p>Well, the simple answer would be no. However, because Monty opens a door, one might think that he does not do that at random and would never do so to reveal the car. If that is a natural assumption to make, then what about Monty opening the door that we chose if it does not hide the car? That would reset the game and increase the probability of us finding the car from 1/3 to 1/2 in the new selection - a 50% increase in probability! It would not make sense for Monty to do that. The final option is for Monty to behave as we assume - i.e.&nbsp;he always opes a door with a goat and never our chosen door.</p>
<p>If we just initially assume Monty behaves randomly, we’d see from repeated trials, that Monty’s choices are not random and are most likely biased in a logical way for him.</p>
</section>
<section id="reinforcement-through-simulation" class="level1">
<h1>Reinforcement through simulation</h1>
<p>To further reinforce the understanding of the Monty Hall Problem, we can simulate the game multiple times to see how often switching versus staying leads to winning the car. Below is a simple Python simulation that demonstrates this. The contestant and host choices are randomly (pseud-randomly) generated to mimic the game scenario. The simulation is run for a large number of trials to get statistically significant results, providing a point estimate of the probability of choosing the right door <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> vs.&nbsp;switching <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1-p">.</p>
<p>This code is essentially simulating a Bernoulli process where each trial results in either a win or a loss based on the chosen strategy (switching or staying). By running the simulation multiple times, we can estimate the sample probabilities of winning for each strategy, taking advantage of the law of large numbers for the sample probabilities converging towards the true probabilities.</p>
<p>Run the following code cell by clicking “RUN CODE” in the upper right corner. Adjust the code as you please to experiment with different numbers of trials or strategies.</p>
