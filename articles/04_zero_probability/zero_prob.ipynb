    "Consider the set $\\Omega$ containing all possible events, or outcomes of a random process. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a subset of $\\Omega$ containing events that meet a certain criteria, which we can also call a *family* of events. The probability of a family of events $\\mathcal{F}$ is the mapping $P(\\mathcal{F}) \\to \\mathbb{R}$, which describes the applicable proability distribution between different events $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",

    "The triple $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P)$ defines the probability space.\n",

    "## Discrete random variables\n",
    "A typical example is a six-sided dice, where the outcomes of one toss are in the set $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 6\\}$. $\\mathcal{F}$ are all possible subsets of $\\Omega$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let the random variable $X$ describe the outcome of a dice throw, i.e. $X \\in \\Omega$. We can define the subsets $\\mathcal{F}$ based on desired values of $X$, i.e. for $X=2$ or for $X$ to be even, as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of a familiy of events $\\mathcal{F}$, i.e. $P(\\mathcal{F})$ - assuming uniform probabilities - is the mapping\n",

    "So the probability of a singe value of $X$, i.e. $\\mathcal{F} = \\{X | X \\in \\Omega, X=2\\} = \\{2\\}$ is $P(\\mathcal{F}) = P(X=2) = 1/6$ and is $3/6=1/2$ to throw an even or odd value.\n",

    "## Continuous random variables\n",

    "This outcome set has infinitely many elmements, i.e. there are infinitely many real numbers between 0 and 1. Consequently, a uniform probability mapping $P$ is undefined due to the denominator being infinite. We can still assign a value to the probability of choosing a single real number $a$ from a subset $\\Omega_N$ with $N$ elements, which contains $a$, and let $\\Omega_N \\to \\Omega$\n",
