    "Consider the set $\\Omega$ containing all possible events, or outcomes of a random process. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a subset of $\\Omega$ containing events that meet a certain criteria, which we can also call the event space. The probability function $P$ is a set function that assigns each event $E \\in \\mathcal{F}$ its probability $P(E): \\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\Omega \\to [0, 1]$.\n",

    "A typical example is a six-sided dice, where the outcomes of one toss are in the set $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 6\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the random variable $X$ describe the outcome of a die throw, i.e. $X \\in \\Omega$. We can define the event space $\\mathcal{F}$ based on desired values of $X$, i.e. for $X=2$ or for $X$ to be even, as an example.\n",

    "For the dice, the random variable $X$ is discrete, i.e. it can only take certain specific values. We can also consider a continous random variable.\n",

Consequently, a uniform probability mapping $P$ is undefined due to the denominator being infinite. We can still assign a value to the probability of choosing a single real number $a$ from a subset $\\Omega_N$ with $N$ elements, which contains $a$, and let $\\Omega_N \\to \\Omega$\n",

Drawing $a=0.5$ from the real interval $[0, 1]$ under uniform probabilities is perferctly reasonable, but extremely improbable considering the infinite number of possible draws.
