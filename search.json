    "text": "But seriously…\nThis is the typical starting point for anyone writing down the 2nd law of motion. But it’s just not what it is.\nThe version written above is a special case. Firstly, acceleration \\(a\\) is a vector, so we should writhe \\(\\vec{a}\\) instead of \\(a\\). If our analysis is one dimensional - then we can reduce \\(\\vec{a}\\) to \\(a\\), but in general it is a vector quantity as a vector can be one dimensions - or however many dimensions you like.\nSecondly, Newton wasn’t thinking about acceleration of a fixed mass - rather he was thinking about how momentum changes with time. His original formulation was \\[\\vec{F}=\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}.\\]\nWhere \\(\\vec{p}\\) is momentum, defined as: \\[\\vec{p}=m\\vec{v},\\]\nand \\(\\vec{F}\\) is the total external force acting upon a system. So a total force \\(\\vec{F}\\) causes a change in momentum \\(\\vec{p}\\) with respect to time \\(t\\) - and an observed change in momentum can be related to a total force \\(\\vec{F}\\) acting on the system.\nIn the absence of external forces, \\(\\vec{F}=0\\), momentum is conserved, i.e. \\(\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}=0\\) - i.e. it does not change with time.\nA conserved quantity in physics is gold - as it allows us to relate two states of a system without knowing the details of how the system got from one state to another, since (in this case) the momentum is the same at both states. Another key conserved quantity is energy \\(E\\).\nSince mass \\(m\\) is a scalar, and velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) is a vector, the momentum is a scaled velocity vector, i.e. it has the same direction as velocity, but its magnitude is scaled by mass."

For two dimensions, the vector equation encodes two scalar equations (one for each component), and in three dimensions it encodes three scalar equations."

They are not just equations to be memorized, but rather they are the foundation upon which we build our understanding of mechanics.\nWhen we start with the more general form of Newton’s 2nd law, we are reminded that forces cause changes in momentum, and that momentum can change not only due to changes in velocity but also due to changes in mass. This broader perspective is crucial for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena.\nInstead of starting half way down the road with \\(F=ma\\), starting with \\(\\vec{F}=d\\vec{p}/dt\\) and then performing acceptable adjustments or simplifacations to the problem at hand keeps us grounded in the fundamental concepts of physics and encourages us to think more deeply about the systems we are analyzing.

    "text": "Deriving the rocket equation\nLet’s develop the equation of motion for a rocket in one dimension. We start with the general form\n\\[\\vec{F} = \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = m\\vec{a} + \\frac{dm}{dt}\\vec{v}.\\]\nEvery rocket, regardless of the actual propulsion device, generates thrust by expelling mass. The \\(dm/dt\\) term is therefore important for thrust. There is however a problem with this formulation - without additional context. A stationary rocket (\\(v=0\\)) can generate thrust by expelling mass \\(dm/dt&lt;0\\). However, that term vanishes at time \\(t=0\\) if \\(\\vec{v}(0)=\\vec{0}\\).\nWe need to clarify that \\(\\vec{v}=\\vec{v}(t)\\) in the above formulation is the velocity of the expelled mass relative to the rocket. Let’s call that velocity \\(\\vec{V}_e\\), which has direction opposite the rocket’s velocity vector \\(\\vec{v}\\),\n\\[\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a} - \\frac{dm}{dt}\\vec{V}_e.\\]\nIn the absence of the atmosphere, we can ignore aerodynamic drag. However, to allow for it, we’ll leave the external force component \\(F\\) in the equation, to yield after rearranging.\nAs we are in one dimenson, we can drop the vector notation,\n\\[F = ma - \\frac{dm}{dt}V_e.\\]\nSince the term \\(\\frac{dm}{dt}V_e\\) is thrust (a force), we can rearrange the terms to obtain\n\\[F + \\frac{dm}{dt}V_e = ma.\\]\nAs \\(dm/dt&lt;0\\) and \\(V_e&lt;0\\) the thrust term is positive - which makes sense. Increased thrust should yield an increase in acceleration \\(a\\) for a given mass \\(m\\).\nIt is understandable that this derivation leaves some questions unanswered. In particular, consider that we have the acceleration term of the rocket \\(\\vec{a}=\\vec{a}(t)\\) in an inertial frame of reference, but the thrust component has a velocity \\(\\vec{V}_e\\) which is observed in the rocket’s frame of reference. How does that make sense?\n\nA deeper dive into the rocket equation\nConsider the following two states of the rocket, one at time \\(t\\) before a mass \\(dm\\) is expelled, and one a short time interval \\(dt\\) after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Conservation of momentum for rocket at a given time\n\n\n\nThe quantity \\(dm\\) is the change in rocket mass, which is negative. The mass of the expelled fuel is therefore -dm.\nThe differential change in momentum \\(dp\\) between these two different points in time is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    p(t+dt) - p(t)  &= -dm (\\vec{v}+\\vec{V}_e) + (m-dm)(\\vec{v}+d\\vec{v}) - m\\vec{v}\\\\\n                    &= -dm (\\vec{v}+\\vec{V}_e-\\vec{v}-d\\vec{v}) + m\\vec{v} - m\\vec{v} - md\\vec{v}\\\\\n                    &= -dm \\vec{V}_e - \\underbrace{(dm)(d\\vec{v})}_{\\approx 0} + md\\vec{v}\\\\\n                    &= -dm \\vec{V}_e + md\\vec{v}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nKeep in mind that the inertial velocity vector of the exhaust mass \\(dm\\) is \\(\\vec{v}+\\vec{V}_e\\), while \\(\\vec{V}_e\\) is the exhaust velocity vector relative to the rocket (accelerating frame of reference).\nThe second order differential component \\(dmd\\vec{v}\\) is much smaller than other components, and is thus taken to be zero.\nWe have now set up a finite difference in momentum \\(\\Delta \\vec{p}\\) between these two points in time. Dividing both sides by \\(\\Delta t\\) and taking the limit as \\(t \\to 0\\) yields\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} &= m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} - \\frac{dm}{dt}\\vec{V}_e\\\\\n                        &= m\\vec{a} - \\frac{dm}{dt}\\vec{V}_e.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAs before, we can drop the vector notation,\n\\[F = ma - \\frac{dm}{dt}V_e,\\]\nand finally rearrange to\n\\[F + \\frac{dm}{dt}V_e = ma.\\]\nKeep in mind that \\(dm/dt &lt; 0\\) and \\(V_e&lt;0\\), so the thrust term is positive.\n\n\nWhat does this demonstrate\nThis derivation shows that even starting with the general form of\n\\[F = \\frac{dp}{dt} = ma + \\frac{dm}{dt}v,\\]\ncan even be a step to far in some cases.\nFor the rocket, considering \\(\\vec{p}=m\\vec{v}\\) and taking its time derivative is not a representative model of the rocket’s change in momentum with time.\nWe should have started with \\(dp/dt\\) and derived that relation and then relate it to any external forces with the 2nd law - as was shown above."

    "section": "A tangent - mass and the 2nd law in other contexts",
    "text": "A tangent - mass and the 2nd law in other contexts\nLet’s venture off on a tangent from this topic and consider mass in other contexts.\nIn simple terms, mass is a measure of inertia. Inertia is the resistance of an object to change in its state of motion. The greater the mass, the greater the inertia, and the more force is required to change its momentum.\nContrast this to a large corporation. A large corporation has a lot of inertia - it is resistant to change. Changing the direction of a large corporation requires significant effort and resources, much like changing the momentum of a massive object requires a large force. It is much easier to change the direction of a small startup company (low mass) than a large multinational corporation (high mass).\nHowever, the mass of a corporation is not fixed. Mergers, acquisitions, layoffs, and growth can all change the “mass” of a corporation over time. This is analogous to the variable mass scenarios in physics where the mass of a system changes with time. However, in this context, these changes with time are not continuous, so the function \\(m(t)\\) is not differentiable everywhere.\n\nParkinson’s Law - the mass of bureaucracy\nParkinson’s Law states that “work expands to fill the time available for its completion.” In the context of a corporation, this can be interpreted as the tendency for bureaucratic processes to grow in complexity and size over time, regardless of the actual workload. This growth in bureaucracy can be seen as an increase in the “mass” of the corporation, making it more resistant to change and less agile.\nThis means that the change in mass of government - and thus of its inertia - is always increasing with time, i.e. \\(dm/dt&gt;0\\) always. As such, considering it at moving at constant velocity at a given time (\\(d\\vec{v}/dt=0\\)), the magnitude of the force needed to make any change also increases with time \\(\\left|{d\\vec{F}/dt}\\right|&gt;0\\). In other words, it just gets harder and harder with time to notice any impact of changes made, or a lot more effort has to be expelled for a unit change to be observed. This is an interesting contrast to physical systems where mass can both increase and decrease with time.\nHowever, I have worked in companies that display a chronic beurocratic bloat, where the mass seems to increase without bound. In such cases, the corporation becomes so massive and inertial that it is nearly impossible to change its direction or adapt to new circumstances. So this is not limited to just government…"

Instead, what this solution tells us, is that by following the strategy of switching doors, we can expect to win in 66.7% of the time, and lose in 33.3% of the time. We should observe this to be the outcome in repeated trials and approach these values as more and more trials are done. This is what we observed in the simulation in Part 1.\nHowever, keep in mind, the above calculations are not a simulation of the problem, but exact mathematical calculations. The solution is therefore exact and complete, given our assumptions of the problem and our Bayesian interpretation of probabilities.\nThere is something inherently beautiful in having mathematics, the language of reason and logic, yield us the solution without having any prior bias towards the outcome - although in this case we have an expectation towards the outcome, but none of that was part of the derivation of the above solution.\nGiven the debates this problem has stirred in the past - based on its counterintuitive solution - a mathematical approach is indeed the only way to justify the outcome."

If a subsequent event is dependent on the outcome of a previous event, we’d have to look at conditional probabilites given the outcome of the first event.\nIn the beginning, we have three doors, and the probability of the car being behind any door is 1/3. When you pick a door, you have a 1/3 chance of having picked the car and a 2/3 chance of having picked a goat. We do not know where the car is, and do not have any other information at this time to help us make a better choice. The probabilities are uniformly distributed between all options.\nHowever, after we make our initial choice, the host’s action is not random - it’s deterministic and dependent our chosen door and where the car is (which he knows).\n\nTherein lies the key to understanding the problem\nThe host knows where the car is and once we choose a door, he will always open a door that has a goat behind it. This biased action provides us with new information that changes the probabilities. We can reinforce this understanding by considering the following:\n\nThe host will never open the door you initially picked.\nThe host knows where the car is and will always open a door with a goat behind it.\n\nOut of the two doors we did not choose, the host’s choice between those two doors provides valuable information to our problem which is not random, and thus allows us to update our probabilities for the remaining two unopened doors.\nHowever, had the host opened a door at random, even possibly the one we initially picked, the probabilities would remain 50/50 between the two remaining doors, as no new information would have been provided that allows us to updated our probabilities from the initial uniform probabilities. In other words, the host’s choices would be Independent and Identically Distributed as our choice of door to open."

    "text": "The solution\nSo, here is the full solution.\nWe have gone over the probabilities at the initial choice of door by the contestant, the one chosen has probability \\(p=1/3\\) of having the car, the other two doors have a combined probability of \\(1-p=2/3\\) of having the car. The probabilities add up to 1 since there is only one car and one door must be opened - i.e. something will happen, either a car is revealed or not.\nAlthough there is 2/3 probability of the car being behind either of the other two doors, we don’t know which one out of those two to pick. We need more information to make a better choice.\nHowever, the host’s knowledge and actions will help us with this problem. Since the host will only choose a door out of the two unchosen doors, and will never open the door with the car - should it be behind either of them - the other door he did not choose becomes more valuable to us, since the full 2/3 probability of the car being behind either of the two unchosen doors now tranfers fully to the door not chosen by the host. We now don’t have to choose between the other two doors, the host has eliminated one for us free of charge. This is called variable change - i.e the actions by the host changes the variables of our problem.\nThere is a famous classroom scene in the movie “21” from 2008 where this is explained quite well (see below). There is also a great numberphile video explaining the problem and solution in detail.\nHere is the scene from 21:\n\n\nHere is the numberphile video:\n\n\nThe scene from 21 is also of interest from the other topic discussed, namely Newton’s method - or Newton-Raphson method - for finding roots of functions and the possible issues with that method. This is a topic for another time though."

    "text": "Different host behavior\nIt is important to note that the solution to the Monty Hall Problem is dependent on the host’s behavior. If the host’s actions were different, the probabilities and optimal strategy could change. For example, if the host were to open a door at random, without knowledge of what is behind the doors, the probabilities would indeed be 50/50 between the two remaining doors after one is opened, and switching or staying would not matter. In other words, such behaviour by the host would not provide any additional information to the contestant.\nWe can look at various different host behaviors and see how they affect the solution:\n\nHost always opens a door with a goat (standard Monty Hall Problem): The optimal strategy is to always switch, giving a 2/3 chance of winning the car.\nHost opens a door at random: It does not matter if you stick with your first choice or change to the other remaining door, as the probabilities are 50/50 between the two remaining doors.\nHost only opens a door if the contestant initially picked the car: In this case, the optimal strategy is to always stick with the original choice, as switching would lead to a guaranteed loss.\nHost opens a door only if the contestant initially picked a goat: Here, the optimal strategy is to always switch, as switching would lead to a guaranteed win.\n\nThese variations illustrate how the host’s behavior can significantly impact the probabilities and optimal strategies in the Monty Hall Problem."

Consequently, there are various interpretations and approaches to probability theory. However, given a specific interpretation of what probability is, we base our logic on certain axioms of probability, which are mathematical constructs and not subject to interpretation."

So only values not in \\(\\Omega\\) will have probability zero, i.e. \\(P(X=a)=0\\) only if \\(a \\notin \\Omega\\). That is not an interesting result, and I would say it to be trivial. The only such results which one could possibly argue to be theoretically possible is for the die not to return any element in \\(\\Omega\\), i.e. to return the empty set. That would describe the case where the die ends up balanced on an edge, without any particular side facing up. However, such an outcome has most likely never been observed and is accurately assigned a zero probability by the uniform distribution, i.e. \\(P(X=\\emptyset)=0\\). However, an outcome of values \\(X&gt;6\\) is absurd and will have zero probability since \\(P(X&gt;6) = 1 - P(X \\leq 6) = 1-1 =0\\) - so this result is indeed impossible.\nTherefore, for the discrete random variable case, i.e. \\(X\\) is discrete, with finite possible outcomes in \\(\\Omega\\), the only outcomes with zero probability are those which are impossible by definition."
