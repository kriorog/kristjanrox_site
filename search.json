    "text": "But seriously…\nThis is the typical starting point for anyone writing down the 2nd law of motion. But it’s just not what it is.\nThe version written above is a special case. Firstly, acceleration \\(a\\) is a vector, so we should writhe \\(\\vec{a}\\) instead of \\(a\\). If our analysis is one dimensional - then we can reduce \\(\\vec{a}\\) to \\(a\\), but in general it is a vector quantity as a vector can be one dimensions - or however many dimensions you like.\nSecondly, Newton wasn’t thinking about acceleration of a fixed mass - rather he was thinking about how momentum changes with time. His original formulation was \\[\\vec{F}=\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}.\\]\nWhere \\(\\vec{p}\\) is momentum, defined as: \\[\\vec{p}=m\\vec{v}\\]\nand \\(\\vec{F}\\) is the total external force acting upon a system. So a total force \\(\\vec{F}\\) causes a change in momentum \\(\\vec{p}\\) with respect to time \\(t\\) - and an observed change in momentum can be related to a total force \\(\\vec{F}\\) acting on the system.\nIn the absence of external forces, \\(\\vec{F}=0\\), momentum is conserved, i.e. \\(\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}=0\\) - i.e. it does not change with time.\nA conserved quantity in physics is gold - as it allows us to relate two states of a system without knowing the details of how the system got from one state to another, since (in this case) the momentum is the same at both states. Another key conserved quantity is energy \\(E\\).\nSince mass \\(m\\) is a scalar, and velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) is a vector, the momentum is a scaled velocity vector, i.e. it has the same direction as velocity, but its magnitude is scaled by mass."

This is our familiar form of the 2nd law of motion.\nSo our typical form is just a special case of the more general form.\nBecause this is a vector equation, it encodes quite alot of information. If our problem is one dimensions, this reduces to a scalar equation (one equation). For two dimensions, the vector equation encodes two scalar equations (one for each component), and in three dimensions it encodes three scalar equations."

This broader perspective is crucial for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena.\nInstead of starting half way down the road with \\(F=ma\\), starting with \\(\\vec{F}=d\\vec{p}/dt\\) and then performing acceptable adjustments or simplifacations to the problem at hand keeps us grounded in the fundamental concepts of physics and encourages us to think more deeply about the systems we are analyzing.

    "text": "Deriving the rocket equation\nLet’s develop the equation of motion for a rocket in one dimension. We start with the general form\n\\[\\vec{F} = \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = m\\vec{a} + \\frac{dm}{dt}\\vec{v}.\\]\nEvery rocket, regardless of the actual propulsion device, generates thrust by expelling mass. The \\(dm/dt\\) term is therefore important for thrust. There is however a problem with this formulation - without additional context. A stationary rocket (\\(v=0\\)) can generate thrust by expelling mass \\(dm/dt&lt;0\\). However, that term vanishes at time \\(t=0\\) if \\(\\vec{v}(0)=\\vec{0}\\).\nWe need to clarify that \\(\\vec{v}=\\vec{v}(t)\\) in the above formulation is the velocity of the expelled mass relative to the rocket. Let’s call that velocity \\(\\vec{V}_e\\), which has direction opposite the rocket’s velocity vector \\(\\vec{v}\\),\n\\[\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a} - \\frac{dm}{dt}\\vec{V}_e.\\]\nIn the absence of the atmosphere, we can ignore aerodynamic drag. However, to allow for it, we’ll leave the external force component \\(F\\) in the equation, to yield after rearranging.\nAs we are in one dimenson, we can drop the vector notation,\n\\[F = ma - \\frac{dm}{dt}V_e.\\]\nSince the term \\(\\frac{dm}{dt}V_e\\) is thrust (a force), we can rearrange the terms to obtain\n\\[F + \\frac{dm}{dt}V_e = ma\\]\nAs \\(dm/dt&lt;0\\) and \\(V_e&lt;0\\) the thrust term is positive - which makes sense. Increased thrust should yield an increase in acceleration \\(a\\) for a given mass \\(m\\).\nIt is understandable that this derivation leaves some questions unanswered. In particular, consider that we have the acceleration term of the rocket \\(\\vec{a}=\\vec{a}(t)\\) in an inertial frame of reference, but the thrust component has a velocity \\(\\vec{V}_e\\) which is observed in the rocket’s frame of reference. How does that make sense?\n\nA deeper dive into the rocket equation\nConsider the following two states of the rocket, one at time \\(t\\) before a mass \\(dm\\) is expelled, and one a short time interval \\(dt\\) after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Conservation of momentum for rocket at a given time\n\n\n\nThe quantity \\(dm\\) is the change in rocket mass, which is negative. The mass of the expelled fuel is therefore -dm.\nThe differential change in momentum \\(dp\\) between these two different points in time is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    p(t+dt) - p(t)  &= -dm (\\vec{v}+\\vec{V}_e) + (m-dm)(\\vec{v}+d\\vec{v}) - m\\vec{v}\\\\\n                    &= -dm (\\vec{v}+\\vec{V}_e-\\vec{v}-d\\vec{v}) + m\\vec{v} - m\\vec{v} - md\\vec{v}\\\\\n                    &= -dm \\vec{V}_e - \\underbrace{(dm)(d\\vec{v})}_{\\approx 0} + md\\vec{v}\\\\\n                    &= -dm \\vec{V}_e + md\\vec{v}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nKeep in mind that the inertial velocity vector of the exhaust mass \\(dm\\) is \\(\\vec{v}+\\vec{V}_e\\), while \\(\\vec{V}_e\\) is the exhaust velocity vector relative to the rocket (accelerating frame of reference).\nThe second order differential component \\(dmd\\vec{v}\\) is much smaller than other components, and is thus taken to be zero.\nWe have now set up a finite difference in momentum \\(\\Delta \\vec{p}\\) between these two points in time. Dividing both sides by \\(\\Delta t\\) and taking the limit as \\(t \\to 0\\) yields\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} &= m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} - \\frac{dm}{dt}\\vec{V}_e\\\\\n                        &= m\\vec{a} - \\frac{dm}{dt}\\vec{V}_e.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAs before, we can drop the vector notation,\n\\[F = ma - \\frac{dm}{dt}V_e,\\]\nand finally rearrange to\n\\[F + \\frac{dm}{dt}V_e = ma.\\]\nKeep in mind that \\(dm/dt &lt; 0\\) and \\(V_e&lt;0\\), so the thrust term is positive.\n\n\nWhat does this demonstrate\nThis derivation shows that even starting with the general form of\n\\[F = \\frac{dp}{dt} = ma + \\frac{dm}{dt}v\\]\ncan even be a step to far in some cases. We should have started with \\(dp/dt\\) and derived that relation and then relate it to any external forces with the 2nd law."

    "text": "A tangent - mass and the 2nd law in other contexts\nLet’s venture off on a tangent from this topic and consider mass in other contexts.\nIn simple terms, mass is a measure of inertia. Inertia is the resistance of an object to change in its state of motion. The greater the mass, the greater the inertia, and the more force is required to change its momentum.\nContrast this to a large corporation. A large corporation has a lot of inertia - it is resistant to change. Changing the direction of a large corporation requires significant effort and resources, much like changing the momentum of a massive object requires a large force. It is much easier to change the direction of a small startup company (low mass) than a large multinational corporation (high mass).\nHowever, the mass of a corporation is not fixed. Mergers, acquisitions, layoffs, and growth can all change the “mass” of a corporation over time. This is analogous to the variable mass scenarios in physics where the mass of a system changes with time. However, in this context, these changes with time are not continuous, so the function \\(m(t)\\) is not differentiable everywhere.\n\nParkinson’s Law - the mass of bureaucracy\nParkinson’s Law states that “work expands to fill the time available for its completion.” In the context of a corporation, this can be interpreted as the tendency for bureaucratic processes to grow in complexity and size over time, regardless of the actual workload. This growth in bureaucracy can be seen as an increase in the “mass” of the corporation, making it more resistant to change and less agile.\nThis means that the change in mass of government - and thus of its inertia - is always increasing with time, i.e. \\(dm/dt&gt;0\\) always. As such, considering it at moving at constant velocity at a given time (\\(d\\vec{v}/dt=0\\)), the magnitude of the force needed to make any change also increases with time \\(\\left|{d\\vec{F}/dt}\\right|&gt;0\\). In other words, it just gets harder and harder with time to notice any impact of changes made, or a lot more effort has to be expelled for a unit change to be observed. This is an interesting contrast to physical systems where mass can both increase and decrease with time.\nHowever, I have worked in companies that display a chronic beurocratic bloat, where the mass seems to increase without bound. In such cases, the corporation becomes so massive and inertial that it is nearly impossible to change its direction or adapt to new circumstances. So this is not limited to just government…"

It gained widespread attention after being featured in Marilyn vos Savant’s “Ask Marilyn” column in Parade magazine in 1990.\nMarilyn’s response sparked a significant public debate, as many readers found the solution counterintuitive and disagreed with her explanation. The Monty Hall Problem has since become a classic example in probability theory and is often used to illustrate the importance of considering all available information when making decisions, and who exactly is privy to that information.\nWe’ll explore the problem, its solution, and the reasoning behind it."

So it does not matter whether we switch or stay. However, this is not the case.\nThe correct solution is that you should always switch doors.\nWhy? By switching, you have a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while if you stick with your original choice, you only have a 1/3 chance. This is the solution given by Marilyn vos Savant. However, this solution is dependent on the exact problem statement given. If the problem statement is changed, in particular the host’s behavior, the solution may also change.\nThe disagreements and debates around the Monty Hall Problem often stem from misunderstandings of the problem’s conditions and the role of the host’s actions. Many people assume that the host’s choice to open a door is random, but in reality, the host always opens a door with a goat behind it, which provides additional information that affects the probabilities. In technical terms, the host’s actions are not independent from the contestant’s choice, and this dependency is crucial to understanding the correct solution.\nThe original Ask Marilyn column, vos Savant’s response, and subsequent reader correspondence be found here."

    "text": "It’s all about what information is known\nThe fundamentals of stochastic problems are directly related to what information is known and by whom.\nA common assumption in stochastic processes is that different events are Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d). This means that one event does not affect any subsequent events, and they are drawn from the same probability distribution. If a subsequent event is dependent on the outcome of a previous event, we’d have to look at conditional probabilites given the outcome of the first event.\nIn the beginning, we have three doors, and the probability of the car being behind any door is 1/3. When you pick a door, you have a 1/3 chance of having picked the car and a 2/3 chance of having picked a goat. We do not know where the car is, and do not have any other information at this time to help us make a better choice. The probabilities are uniformly distributed between all options.\nHowever, after we make our initial choice, the host’s action is not random - it’s deterministic and dependent on the initial choice which he knows.\n\nTherein lies the key to understanding the problem\nThe host knows where the car is and will always open a door that has a goat behind it. This action provides us with new information that changes the probabilities. We can reinforce this understanding by considering the following:\n\nThe host will never open the door you initially picked.\nThe host knows where the car is and will always open a door with a goat behind it.\n\nOut of the two doors we did not choose, the host’s choice between those two doors provides valuable information to our problem which is not random, and thus allows us to update our probabilities for the remaining two unopened doors.\nHowever, had the host opened a door at random, even possibly the one we initially picked, the probabilities would remain 50/50 between the two remaining doors, as no new information would have been provided that allows us to updated our probabilities from the initial uniform probabilities. In other words, the host’s choices would be Independent and Identically Distributed as our choice of door to open.\nTo contrast this - consider an innocent bystander who knows nothing about what has happened, which door the contestant chose and just sees two doors left unopened. For this bystander, the probabilities are indeed 50/50 between both doors - as they have no additional information - but for you as the contestant, the probabilities are 2/3 in favour of switching from your initial choice."

The probabilities add up to 1 since there is only one car and one door must be opened - i.e. something will happen, either a car is revealed or not.\nAlthough there is 2/3 probability of the car being behind either of the other two doors, we don’t know which one out of those two to pick. We need more information to make a better choice.\nHowever, the host’s knowledge and actions will help us with this problem. Since the host will only choose a door out of the two unchosen doors, and will never open the door with the car - should it be behind either of them - the other door he did not choose becomes more valuable to us, since the full 2/3 probability of the car being behind either of the two unchosen doors now tranfers fully to the door not chosen by the host. We now don’t have to choose between the other two doors, the host has eliminated one for us free of charge. This is called variable change - i.e the actions by the host changes the variables of our problem.\nThere is a famous classroom scene in the movie “21” from 2008 where this is explained quite well (see below). There is also a great numberphile video explaining the problem and solution in detail.\nHere is the scene from 21:\n\n\nHere is the numberphile video:\n\n\nThe scene from 21 is also of interest from the other topic discussed, namely Newton’s method - or Newton-Raphson method - for finding roots of functions and the possible issues with that method.

In other words, such behaviour by the host would not provide any additional information to the contestant.\nWe can look at various different host behaviors and see how they affect the solution:\n\nHost always opens a door with a goat (standard Monty Hall Problem): The optimal strategy is to always switch, giving a 2/3 chance of winning the car.\nHost opens a door at random: It does not matter if you stick with your first choice or change to the other remaining door, as the probabilities are 50/50 between the two remaining doors.\nHost only opens a door if the contestant initially picked the car: In this case, the optimal strategy is to always stick with the original choice, as switching would lead to a guaranteed loss.\nHost opens a door only if the contestant initially picked a goat: Here, the optimal strategy is to always switch, as switching would lead to a guaranteed win.\n\nThese variations illustrate how the host’s behavior can significantly impact the probabilities and optimal strategies in the Monty Hall Problem."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Sadi Carnot - who?\nWell, every engineer worth his salt will remember Sadi Carnot from their thermodynamic classes. The Carnot heat engine is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics - which establishes the maximum possible efficiency that any heat engine can achieve when operating between two temperature reservoirs. This is quite an important concept - and an interesting answer to an even more interesting question.\nIt does not matter what setting one finds oneself - be it in engineering, business, or even personal life - the question of “How well can I do?” is always relevant. Given the constraints of my situation - what is the best possible outcome that I can achieve? This is where the concept of relative performance analysis comes into play.\n\n\nLet’s first clarify what is meant by relative performance analysis.\nWe can use the first law of thermodynamics as a simple benchmark - although we are absolutely not limiting ourselves to thermodynamics. The first law states that energy is conserved, i.e. it is not created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. For a heat engine, which we want to produce work \\(W\\) for us, the total work output is equal to the heat input \\(Q_{in}\\) minus the heat rejection \\(Q_{out}\\). An absolute efficiency of this system is calculated by looking at the work achieved compared to the heat input, i.e. how much did we put in and how much of value did we get out, or\n\\[\\eta_{absolute} = \\frac{W}{Q_{in}} = \\frac{Q_{in} - Q_{out}}{Q_{in}} = 1 - \\frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{in}}\\]\nThe relation \\(W=Q_{in}-Q_{out}\\) is the first law.\nGiven the constraints of the 2nd law - i.e. entropy must always increase - \\(\\eta_{absolute}\\) can never be 100% - there will always be some heat rejected to the cold reservoir, i.e. \\(Q_{out}&gt;0\\).\nSince we can’t achieve 100% efficiency, the value of this efficiency paramenter is questionable, since we don’t know how high it can be? So what does \\(\\eta_{absolute}=0.74\\) mean for us if we don’t know it’s upper bound? This is where Sadi Carnot comes in - and relative performance analysis.\n\n\n\nSince a heat engine’s performance is limited by the 2nd law of thermodynamics, Sadi Carnot asked the right question - what is the maximum possible efficiency that a heat engine can achieve when operating between two temperature reservoirs?\nHis ideal heat engine - the Carnot engine - operates on a reversible cycle between a hot reservoir at temperature \\(T_{hot}\\) and a cold reservoir at temperature \\(T_{cold}\\). The efficiency of the Carnot engine is given by: \\[\\eta_{Carnot} = 1 - \\frac{T_{cold}}{T_{hot}}\\]\nSo it makes no relation to the actual engine itself - as it is ideal - but is only limited by the temperatures of the heat reservoirs between which it operates. By inspection, increasing the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs increases the maximum possible efficiency.\nNow we have an upper bound on our efficiency - and we can make better use of the absoluted efficiency by comparing it to the Carnot efficiency. This gives us the relative efficiency: \\[\\eta_{relative} = \\frac{\\eta_{absolute}}{\\eta_{Carnot}} = \\frac{W/Q_{in}}{1 - T_{cold}/T_{hot}}\\]\nCan we build a heat engine that has the ideal Carnot efficiency? No, because it would require reversible processes, which are not achievable in practice. However, by comparing our actual engine’s efficiency to the Carnot efficiency, we can assess how well our engine performs relative to the theoretical maximum - not the absolute 1st law constraint.\n\n\n\nThe concept of relative performance analysis can be applied to various fields beyond thermodynamics. In business, for example, companies can evaluate their performance relative to industry benchmarks or best practices. Instead of just looking at absolute metrics like revenue or profit, they can assess how well they are doing compared to the best possible outcomes given their market conditions. Similarly, in personal development, individuals can measure their progress relative to their potential or goals rather than just absolute achievements.\nHow do we determine these benchmarks or best practices? This is where domain expertise and analysis come into play. By understanding the constraints and opportunities within a specific field, we can establish meaningful benchmarks that reflect the best possible outcomes.\nWe can use the tools of mathematical modelling and optimization to help us establish the optimal benchmarks - just like Sadi Carnot did for heat engines. By identifying the key variables and constraints in a given situation, we can develop models that help us understand the limits of performance and identify strategies for improvement.\nEverything we do is subject to constraints - be it physical, economic, or personal. We also have certain objectives in mind for each process, be it profit or cost, etc. By adopting a relative performance analysis approach, we can gain a deeper understanding of our capabilities and identify pathways for growth and improvement. Just like Sadi Carnot’s insights revolutionized thermodynamics, applying similar principles in other fields can lead to significant advancements and better outcomes.\n\n\n\nOf course.\nSince we are always subject to constraints, we can always look for ways to improve our outcomes by investigating strategies to change these constraints.\nLet’s say we have a mathematical optimzation model for our process - in whatever industry or setting. We solve that problem and optain an optimal solution. That is not the end of the story. There are ways to possibly achieve a better result - but it may need some increase in cost, additional effort, or investment.\nHere is where duality theory comes into play. In simple tems, duality theory provides insights into the optimal solution to a problem by determining the change in the objective function value given a change in a constraint. In real world terms, this means that we can assess how much additional profit we can achieve if we invest more resources, or how much cost we can save if we relax certain constraints. By analyzing the dual variables associated with the constraints in our optimization model, we can identify which constraints are most critical to our performance and explore strategies for improvement.\nInvestingating the dual solution to an optimzation problem is a key step that I emphasized to engineering studient - because the model that we set up and solved is the the only way the look at the real-world problem."

    "text": "Let’s first clarify what is meant by relative performance analysis.\nWe can use the first law of thermodynamics as a simple benchmark - although we are absolutely not limiting ourselves to thermodynamics. The first law states that energy is conserved, i.e. it is not created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. For a heat engine, which we want to produce work \\(W\\) for us, the total work output is equal to the heat input \\(Q_{in}\\) minus the heat rejection \\(Q_{out}\\). An absolute efficiency of this system is calculated by looking at the work achieved compared to the heat input, i.e. how much did we put in and how much of value did we get out, or\n\\[\\eta_{absolute} = \\frac{W}{Q_{in}} = \\frac{Q_{in} - Q_{out}}{Q_{in}} = 1 - \\frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{in}}\\]\nThe relation \\(W=Q_{in}-Q_{out}\\) is the first law.\nGiven the constraints of the 2nd law - i.e. entropy must always increase - \\(\\eta_{absolute}\\) can never be 100% - there will always be some heat rejected to the cold reservoir, i.e. \\(Q_{out}&gt;0\\).\nSince we can’t achieve 100% efficiency, the value of this efficiency paramenter is questionable, since we don’t know how high it can be? So what does \\(\\eta_{absolute}=0.74\\) mean for us if we don’t know it’s upper bound? This is where Sadi Carnot comes in - and relative performance analysis."
